<h1>Noah Karpinski</h1>
<p>
	I am an upcoming Computer Science graduate at Northwestern University. I have a diverse mix of research and industry experience that will serve me well as a Software Engineering for Discover. Over the summer of 2018, I was able to collaborate with both Sony and Northwestern to design a network system that analyzes and learns about an environment. Through this process, I was able to work with both software engineers and computer scientists. Also, I am leading a team of 8 students to create a system where a virtual reality user’s movement is mapped and translated to a robot’s motion. Additionally, I collaborated on a team to design a machine learning algorithm that predicts the popularity of an Instagram post form attributes like the number of hashtags or words used. Finally, during my years at Northwestern I have been able to research new technologies like the HTC Vive VR system using C++ and C#.
